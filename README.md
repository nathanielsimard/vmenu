# VMenu

(Neo)Vim Menu that maps keys to actions inspired by Spacemacs

## Install

You can use your favorite vim plugin manager.
An example with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'nathanielsimard/vmenu'
```

## Vim Users

Vim needs to be in `nocompatible` mode to use the filetype keybindings.

```vim
set nocompatible
```
